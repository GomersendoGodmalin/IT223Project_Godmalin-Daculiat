                    <p>Phead Tour Black M2 looks pretty standard for a wireless headphone in this price range; their sleek and modern design, with a premium matte finish and subtle silver accents give them a sophisticated look. In fact, because this simple design is so popular, some may even find the headphones a bit plain and uninspiring, preferring more vibrant color options like JBL has offered in the past.</p>

                    <p>The Phead Letshuoer has a sleek, industrial aesthetic with its matte silver, aluminum alloy housing. The jutted out shiny rectangle on the faceplate also adds a touch of pizzaz to an otherwise unexceptional look. And judging by the weight and feel, the S12 appears to be a durable IEM that can withstand being tossed around and stuffed in a pocket preferring more vibrant color options like the past.</p>
