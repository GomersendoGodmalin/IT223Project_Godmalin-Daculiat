                <!--<h2>Find The Beat</h2>-->
                <p>Phead started with two classmates (Godmalin and Daculiat) with a shared love for listening devices and the desire to share this passion with others. We strongly believe that great sound quality is one of life's purest pleasures and that quality audio devices by extension lead to a better life.
                </p>
                <p>We are a young team with enormous love for headset who dares to think big and isn't afraid to be different. Most importantly,
                    we believe that every headset can be a special experience and has the power to turn your day into a great one.
                </p>
